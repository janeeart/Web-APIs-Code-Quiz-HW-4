# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz-HW-4

This web application is a timed coding quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that has multiple-choice questions. Scores can be stored after each game played in order to gauge player progress. This web application was built without the use of starter code. 

## Description
The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. This app emphasizes the use of JavaScript to populate quiz questions, to collect and store local user data, and to generate a score based on the remaining time on the timer which is appended to a separate high scores page.
